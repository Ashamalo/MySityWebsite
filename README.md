# Project Documentation: "We are real WEB-DEVELOPERS"

## Project Overview
A responsive website showcasing web development skills. Key sections include:
- **Header** with desktop and mobile navigation.
- **Intro block** with buttons and overlay effects.
- **Skills gallery** using CSS Grid.
- **Subscription form** and posts section.
- **Responsive design** for screen sizes down to 576px.

## Implementation Features
### Technologies
- **HTML5**, **CSS3** (using CSS Grid and Flexbox).
- **SCSS** for styling architecture.
- **Media queries** for mobile adaptation.
- **Font Awesome** for icons.

### SCSS Structure
- **Component-based approach**: Styles split into files (`header.scss`, `gallery.scss`, etc.).
- **Variables and mixins**: Utilized `_variables.scss` and `_mixins.scss`.
- **Critical implementation detail**:
  - `respond-to` mixin used for generating media queries.

### Resolved Issues
- **File import order**: In `index.scss`, `_media.scss` is imported after all components to ensure media queries apply correctly.
